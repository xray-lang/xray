# Canonical XrProgram VM contract

The VM consumes only `XrValidatedProgram` plus one active `XrInstance`. It does not decode program
bytes, call the reference evaluator, reconstruct source types or effects, or consult TargetPlan,
legacy Proto bytecode, or AOT. Every active CoreSpec operation has one explicit typed handler.

`XrProgram` remains the only distributed executable program format. `XrVmCode` is private runtime
state and has no serializer, reader, compatibility promise, or public install header. The baseline
view walks immutable validated rows. The fixed-row view copies only dispatch-shaped instruction
rows and retains references to validated operands and successors. Both views produce the same
logical operation trace. Adaptive quickening remains disabled until a measured policy and its
traceability proof exist.

VM code is qualified by `ExecutionId`, generation, VM build identity, decode policy, and quickening
policy. Execution pins the active generation and refuses retired or successor instances. A private
view can always be discarded and rebuilt from `XrValidatedProgram`; corruption or mismatch cannot
fall back to an older executor.

The `xray_program_vm_runtime` archive is the embeddable product boundary for this stage. Its exact
source closure contains the CoreSpec projection, XrProgram decoder/verifier, immutable target
profile, BoundaryABI/runtime contracts, execution instance, and typed VM. It excludes frontend,
CoreIR writer, reference evaluator, TargetPlan, legacy Proto VM, and AOT. The runtime-only test
links a build-produced XrProgram byte array against this archive and verifies the resulting symbol
closure.

The executor covers all twenty-one current CoreSpec operations. Wave 1 source activates scalar,
control, block arguments, and sealed calls; Wave 2 adds logical aggregate construction/projection
and variant construction/test/projection. Aggregate and variant values use VM-private typed arena
cells and never expose a shared physical layout. Aggregate update and the walking-skeleton
trap/error/profile rows remain source-gated by the operation matrix even though their typed handlers
exist. Native LP64 and explicit foreign ILP32 profiles, resource limits, and generation invalidation
remain covered. Full-language operation families, public embedding ABI, adaptive quickening, and any
persistent private-code cache remain inactive for later tasks.
