# Typed TargetPlan scalar execution contract

TargetPlan schema 12 may carry a canonical per-function instruction table.
Instruction authority is separate from the production AOT family mask: a
verified plan can remain a complete AOT plan while exposing no typed execution
family. A function with zero instruction rows is execution unavailable, never
an empty successful program. The production builder emits a complete group
only for a verified, parameter-free and capture-free, single-return-block
signed-`i64` function whose operations are entirely in the supported family.
Every other function emits zero rows; no partial group or fallback is allowed.

The only supported execution family is a closed straight-line signed `i64`
program consisting of constants, copies, wrapping addition, wrapping
subtraction, wrapping multiplication, and one return. A non-empty function
group must form an exact table partition in canonical function and dense row
order. Its independent verifier requires every referenced slot to belong to
that function and have identical trivial signed-`i64` register and memory
representations. It also proves single assignment, use after definition,
canonical arity and unused fields, and a unique final return. Unknown or
unsupported instructions fail closed.

Instruction rows participate in the TargetPlan fingerprint, the bounded XTP
section directory, the exact 32-byte row codec, and candidate materialization.
The internal scalar dispatcher accepts only an immutable verified plan, its
exact fingerprint, a derived nonzero function execution family, and exact
typed-frame slot identities. It independently recomputes the target-content
fingerprint and does not inspect SemanticPlan or Xi. It has no legacy VM
opcode, `XrValue`, AOT, or generated-C fallback.

Schema 12 is a hard cutover from v11. It preserves the closure-storage,
coroutine-state-call, TargetProfile schema 2 String-literal contract, and
String-literal-storage authorities and the sealed, independently reconstructed
`Channel.close()` descriptor and direct-local-callee storage while adding
Channel-allocation storage and adds exact Channel-receive storage. Its
`Channel.close()` receiver is a dispatch target,
not a call argument or authorized frame slot, and it grants no general method
ABI or typed execution path. The String-literal family's
dynamic/owned/tagged row describes only an exact frozen String literal's outer
value and grants no object allocation, root-map, cleanup, tuple, or general
owned-String authority. The closure-storage family's dynamic/owned/tagged row describes
only the outer `XrValue` storage of an exact no-capture heap closure. It grants
no typed instruction, callable-body, allocation, root-map, root-slot, or
cleanup execution authority; the scalar dispatcher continues to reject it.
The direct-local-callee-storage row is a borrowed dynamic outer `XrValue`
token. Independent builder, Target verifier, and AOT materialization verifier
prove that every use is operand zero of the same frozen direct-local call and
that the live shared slot names the unique canonical child. It grants no
closure allocation, body, root, cleanup, or indirect-call authority.
The Channel-allocation-storage family binds an exact frozen `XI_CHAN_NEW`
result to owned dynamic outer `XrValue` storage and exact identity-copy aliases
to borrowed dynamic outer storage. Independent builder, Target verifier, and
AOT materialization verifier separately reconstruct the canonical allocation
key/id, Channel element and capacity types, ownership/provenance, and copy
shape. This family supplies no Channel object-body layout, allocation
execution, root map, root slot, cleanup, transfer-plan, tuple, or general
object authority.
The Channel-receive-storage family binds only an exact frozen
`XI_CHAN_TRY_RECV` scalar result to trivial native storage after independently
proving that its receiver belongs to the Channel-allocation identity chain and
that `Channel<T>`'s sole child is the result type. It grants no receive
scheduling, Channel body, ownership-transfer, aggregate, tuple, root, or
cleanup authority.
The C emission projection schema 8 mechanically spells all verified dynamic
families as exact `TAGGED`/`XrValue` rows. For an exact String literal it also
owns the immutable literal bytes and the explicit String-view materialization
recipe. For exact `XI_CHAN_NEW` it owns the helper spelling and capacity
semantic-value recipe. For exact `XI_CHAN_TRY_RECV` it owns the receiver
semantic value and exact scalar unbox helper spelling. Sync and coroutine CGen
consume those recipes mechanically and have no Xi/type or legacy fallback.
The independent verifier reconstructs expected literal bytes only from the
frozen SemanticPlan bound through TargetPlan and rejects missing, extra,
reordered, wrong-kind, wrong-spelling, wrong-operand, wrong-recipe, profile, target, and
projection fingerprint mutations.

The runtime generation authority exposes this family through one public
product route: exact XSM bytes construct runtime-owned semantic and native
profile authority, which may load their matching XTP into a sole-function
scalar-i64 generation and execute function 0. PREPARE requires exactly one
canonical function, this exact nonempty execution family, the typed-frame
schema/family closure, and no storage, allocation, call, root, cleanup,
adapter, or coroutine execution authority. Execution requires healthy ACTIVE
state and a balanced in-flight-call pin. This adds no public CLI, export
selection, or general typed VM instruction coverage, control flow, calls,
aggregates, ownership, exceptions, coroutines, or complete typed TargetPlan
VM execution.

The required `COROUTINE_STATE_CALL` family is independent of this
dispatcher. It freezes only the state/resume/direct-call/result-slot relation;
it does not activate coroutine execution or supply child-frame, spill, root,
cleanup, drop, cancel, or action authority.

Evidence:

- `test_typed_dispatch` proves zero-row rejection, wrapping scalar execution,
  production construction and unsupported-function omission,
  SemanticPlan-independent execution, exact XTP roundtrip execution,
  fingerprint/content rejection, prior-schema rejection, and fail-closed mutation of
  opcode, def-use, row identity, function identity, and return structure.
- `test_xtp_format` proves the instruction row width is part of the complete
  exact codec registry and exercises the public XSM/XTP generation route.
- `test_typed_frame_runtime_archive` proves the dispatcher and verifier link
  into the runtime-only archive; the runtime artifact archive gate separately
  proves the exact XSM/XTP sole-function product route.
- `test_runtime_generation` proves exact sole-function PREPARE, ACTIVE scalar
  execution, unsupported-plan rejection, bounded pins, drain, retirement, and
  unload without any legacy execution fallback.
