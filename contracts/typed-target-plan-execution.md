# Typed TargetPlan scalar execution contract

TargetPlan schema 19 may carry a canonical per-function instruction table.
Instruction authority is separate from the production AOT family mask: a
verified plan can remain a complete AOT plan while exposing no typed execution
family. A function with zero instruction rows is execution unavailable, never
an empty successful program. The production builder emits a complete group
only for a verified, capture-free, single-return-block signed-`i64` function
whose declared parameters are all exact signed `i64` and whose operations are
entirely in the supported family. Every other function emits zero rows; no
partial group or fallback is allowed.

The only supported execution family is a closed straight-line signed `i64`
program consisting of constants, parameter bindings, copies, wrapping
addition, wrapping subtraction, wrapping multiplication, bitwise and, or,
exclusive or, wrapping negation, bitwise complement, masked left shift, masked
arithmetic right shift, and one return. A
non-empty function group must form an exact table partition in canonical
function and dense row order. Its independent verifier requires every
referenced slot to belong to that function and have identical trivial
signed-`i64` register and memory representations. It also proves single
assignment, use after definition, canonical arity and unused fields, and a
unique final return. Unknown or unsupported instructions fail closed.

A shift row takes its count modulo 64, which is the language rule and the
same shared shift owner the bytecode VM, the AOT runtime, and constant folding
already consume, so the executor cannot diverge from them and can never reach
C's undefined shift. There is no immediate shift form: the verifier rejects a
non-zero immediate on a shift row, so a count always arrives through a defined
exact-`i64` slot of that function and is masked on the way in. No further
static range proof exists or is needed, because the language leaves no `i64`
count undefined. The right shift is arithmetic; only exact signed `i64` rows
are admitted at all, so an unsigned shift is unavailable rather than silently
zero filling.

A parameter row is a definition, not a computation: its immediate is the
incoming argument ordinal and its result slot is the function's parameter
slot. Nothing is implicitly live at entry, so reading a parameter is proved by
the same use-after-definition rule as any other value. The builder commits a
group only when the frozen parameter record and the operation agree on
ordinal, function, exact type, and SSA value, and only when every declared
parameter is bound exactly once. The independent verifier separately proves
that argument ordinals are unique and dense from zero, that only a parameter
row may define a parameter-role slot, and that the count of parameter rows
equals the number of parameter-role slots the function frame declares. The
executable family caps parameters at 64 so that density is proved without
allocating.

Instruction rows participate in the TargetPlan fingerprint, the bounded XTP
section directory, the exact 32-byte row codec, and candidate materialization.
The internal scalar dispatcher accepts only an immutable verified plan, its
exact fingerprint, a derived nonzero function execution family, a positional
signed-`i64` argument vector, and exact typed-frame slot identities. It
independently recomputes the target-content fingerprint and does not inspect
SemanticPlan or Xi. The verified rows are the only signature it honours: the
argument count must equal the number of parameter rows, and a shorter,
longer, or absent vector is rejected before the frame exists rather than
truncated, padded, or zero filled. It has no legacy VM opcode, `XrValue`, AOT,
or generated-C fallback.

Schema 19 is a hard cutover from v18 and all earlier schemas. It preserves all
v17 authorities while adding exact source unit-enum ordinal storage for
direct-local arguments. The family binds a payload-free source enum's stable
declaration and nominal layout to a trivial signed 64-bit target row and the
exact callee parameter/argument relation. It grants no payload enum, boxing,
allocation, root, cleanup, dispatch, or name-based enum authority.
Schema 17 added an exact borrowed `Slice<byte>` view of String storage.
The view binds the frozen Semantic intrinsic and source root to the exact
`xray-target-string-byte-slice-view-v1` call identity; it grants no generic
String method or slice construction authority. Schema 16 added a sealed
`StringBuilder()` constructor call whose
identity binds the exact Semantic allocation ID and whose result is an owned
dynamic slot. It grants no generic builtin call authority. Its
`Channel.close()` receiver is a dispatch target,
not a call argument or authorized frame slot, and it grants no general method
ABI or typed execution path. The String-literal family's
dynamic/owned/tagged row describes only an exact frozen String literal's outer
value and grants no object allocation, root-map, cleanup, tuple, or general
owned-String authority. The closure-storage family's dynamic/owned/tagged row describes
only the outer `XrValue` storage of an exact no-capture heap closure. It grants
no typed instruction, callable-body, allocation, root-map, root-slot, or
cleanup execution authority; the scalar dispatcher continues to reject it.
The direct-local-callee-storage row is a borrowed dynamic outer `XrValue`
token. Independent builder, Target verifier, and AOT materialization verifier
prove that every use is operand zero of the same frozen direct-local call and
that the live shared slot names the unique canonical child of the first lexical
slot owner. A caller-local store must dominate the load; the only parent-scope
exception is a unique module-root entry-prefix initializer before any
activation-shaped operation. Thus a root-owned sibling helper is exact without
turning arbitrary shared values into call authority. It grants no closure
allocation, body, root, cleanup, or indirect-call authority.
The direct-local-GO-callee-storage row is a distinct borrowed dynamic outer
`XrValue` token. Three independent reconstructions prove one canonical
closure initializer, shared-slot dominance, unique canonical local child and
signature, and that every use is operand zero of `XI_GO` for that same child.
It grants no GO task-result, child-task object, closure allocation/body, root,
cleanup, argument storage, or coroutine execution authority.
The Channel-allocation-storage family binds an exact frozen `XI_CHAN_NEW`
result to owned dynamic outer `XrValue` storage and exact identity-copy aliases
to borrowed dynamic outer storage. Independent builder, Target verifier, and
AOT materialization verifier separately reconstruct the canonical allocation
key/id, Channel element and capacity types, ownership/provenance, and copy
shape. This family supplies no Channel object-body layout, allocation
execution, root map, root slot, cleanup, transfer-plan, tuple, or general
object authority.
The Channel-receive-storage family binds only an exact frozen
`XI_CHAN_TRY_RECV` scalar result to trivial native storage after independently
proving that its receiver belongs to the Channel-allocation identity chain and
that `Channel<T>`'s sole child is the result type. It grants no receive
scheduling, Channel body, ownership-transfer, aggregate, tuple, root, or
cleanup authority.
Schema 17 also preserves SOURCE_EXPORT dispatch authority only when the caller's
verified SemanticPlan is accompanied by its exact ordered verified dependency
plan vector. The Target call row binds dependency ordinal, public export ID,
and dependency callee stable ID, while keeping the target-local callee index
absent. The matching coroutine row binds the same call and result slot. This
is public-wrapper identity and suspension authority only: it supplies no
cross-module argument slots, private/native callee, child frame, roots,
cleanup, drop, cancel, or executable call ABI. Standalone materialization and
all ungrounded method calls remain fail closed.
The dedicated SOURCE-namespace-storage rows cover only the borrowed dynamic
outer `XrValue` tokens in the exact
`IMPORT_REF -> identity COPY* -> SET_SHARED -> GET_SHARED -> identity COPY*`
chain used as SOURCE_EXPORT call receivers. Identity-COPY chains are bounded,
acyclic, and same-function; every endpoint and COPY keeps its own exact slot
identity and unique expected consumer. Three independent reconstructions prove
dependency/module identity, unique shared slot, complete use sets, and receiver
binding. They grant no imported module object body, allocation,
root, cleanup, member lookup, dependency activation, argument ABI, or
cross-module frame.
The C emission projection schema 11 mechanically spells all verified dynamic
families as exact `TAGGED`/`XrValue` rows. For an exact String literal it also
owns the immutable literal bytes and the explicit String-view materialization
recipe. For exact `XI_CHAN_NEW` it owns the helper spelling and capacity
semantic-value recipe. For exact `XI_CHAN_TRY_RECV` it owns the receiver
semantic value and exact scalar unbox helper spelling. Sync and coroutine CGen
consume those recipes mechanically and have no Xi/type or legacy fallback.
The independent verifier reconstructs expected literal bytes only from the
frozen SemanticPlan bound through TargetPlan and rejects missing, extra,
reordered, wrong-kind, wrong-spelling, wrong-operand, wrong-recipe, profile, target, and
projection fingerprint mutations.
For the sealed `StringBuilder()` call it owns the zero-operand
`xrt_strbuf_new` materialization recipe. Sync and coroutine CGen have no
name-based fallback for that constructor. For the exact String byte-slice view,
it owns the `xr_span_t` representation, source semantic value, and fixed
`xrt_span_from_string_bytes` recipe. CGen cannot recover these from selector
text, aliases, mutable Xi types, or legacy representation state.

The runtime generation authority exposes this family through one public
product route: exact XSM bytes construct runtime-owned semantic and native
profile authority, which may load their matching XTP into a sole-function
scalar-i64 generation and execute function 0. PREPARE requires exactly one
canonical function, this exact nonempty execution family, the typed-frame
schema/family closure, and no storage, allocation, call, root, cleanup,
adapter, or coroutine execution authority. Execution requires healthy ACTIVE
state and a balanced in-flight-call pin. That route carries no argument
vector, so a generation whose sole function declares parameters fails closed
instead of executing against implicit zeros. This adds no public CLI, export
selection, or general typed VM instruction coverage, control flow, calls,
aggregates, ownership, exceptions, coroutines, or complete typed TargetPlan
VM execution.

The required `COROUTINE_STATE_CALL` family is independent of this
dispatcher. It freezes only the state/resume/direct-call/result-slot relation;
it does not activate coroutine execution or supply child-frame, spill, root,
cleanup, drop, cancel, or action authority.

Evidence:

- `test_typed_dispatch` proves zero-row rejection, wrapping scalar execution,
  production construction and unsupported-function omission,
  SemanticPlan-independent execution, exact XTP roundtrip execution,
  fingerprint/content rejection, prior-schema rejection, and fail-closed mutation of
  opcode, def-use, row identity, function identity, and return structure. It
  also proves that a two-parameter function emits dense argument ordinals,
  that both arguments reach the executed program in the right positions, and
  that a short, long, or absent argument vector is refused. It proves the
  shift rows against written-out expectations rather than against the shift
  helper itself: sign-replicating right shift, counts of 64 and 67 selecting
  the same shift as 0 and 3, a left shift into the sign bit, and a swapped
  argument pair changing the answer. It rejects an immediate on a shift row,
  a shift missing its count operand, and a count read before its definition.
- `test_xtp_format` proves the instruction row width is part of the complete
  exact codec registry and exercises the public XSM/XTP generation route.
- `test_typed_frame_runtime_archive` proves the dispatcher and verifier link
  into the runtime-only archive; the runtime artifact archive gate separately
  proves the exact XSM/XTP sole-function product route.
- `test_runtime_generation` proves exact sole-function PREPARE, ACTIVE scalar
  execution, unsupported-plan rejection, bounded pins, drain, retirement, and
  unload without any legacy execution fallback.
