# Intrinsic identity contract

Status: re-frozen after the xxHash SVE work added stable runtime-native scalable
SIMD identities without reassigning the existing registry.

1. Each compiler intrinsic has one canonical, stable numeric identity in the
   registry. The identity, not a spelling, import path, method name, or emitted
   C helper name, selects intrinsic semantics.
2. Renaming or moving a source-level API does not silently allocate a new
   semantic identity. Removing or reassigning an identity is a contract change.
3. Analyzer, Xi lowering, optimization, AOT, and VM consumers may carry the
   canonical identity forward; they must not reconstruct it from strings.
4. A registry change must migrate registry uniqueness tests, affected Xi/AOT
   filetests, backend differential cases, and dependent ports evidence.
5. Boundary-only intrinsics such as `mem.assumeInitialized<T>` are sealed
   compiler identities. A library declaration or same-spelled user function
   cannot acquire their proof authority.
6. Target-mode queries such as `simd.Capabilities.isRuntimeSelected()` have
   their own stable identity; they are not inferred from `nativeBytes()` or
   from a backend helper spelling.
