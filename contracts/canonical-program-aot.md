# Canonical XrProgram AOT contract

The AOT compiler accepts only an `XrValidatedProgram`, the exact immutable `XrTargetProfile`, and
`XrBackendOptions`. It builds a private `XrBackendIR`, copies the verified operation graph, and adds
only physical value representations and target literals. Compilation cannot name or acquire a live
`XrInstance`, provider instance, generation, or lease. Lowering and emission do not query source,
AST, Xi, TargetPlan, VM-private code, or the reference evaluator.

Every BackendIR build runs an independent invariant verifier and an exact structural translation
validator. The portable optimization policy currently introduces no high-risk semantic rewrite;
therefore no proof-shaped metadata is fabricated. A future BCE, RC/escape, devirtualization,
coroutine compression, or ABI-changing pass must add a directed witness and checker before it can
become active.

Generated C uses portable C11 typed locals. Checked integer operations avoid signed-overflow
undefined behavior, wrapping operations use unsigned arithmetic plus explicit two's-complement
reconstruction, sealed calls are direct C calls, block arguments use parallel edge copies, and
target queries become literals from `XrTargetProfile`. The existing W1-W4 generated-output
verifier runs before bytes leave the emitter. Strict Clang, Zig CC, and clang-cl frontend tests
compile the real generated translation unit.

Provider-backed operations lower an exact program requirement/operation index to a matching typed
callback slot in the private runtime `XrAotContext` and normalize refusal to the canonical trap.
The admitted logical shapes are nullary/unary i64, `bool(i64)`, nullary optional-i64-pair, and the
dedicated byte sink; no erased provider-call ABI exists. `core.output.group.i64` formats the exact
signed decimal line and performs one output-write call. The Pipe source slice emits target-native
anonymous-pipe open and endpoint-close helpers only for the exact stable operations named by its
profile, while retaining no live provider instance or lease in the compiler. Embedded AOT receives
typed callbacks from its host; hosted standalone AOT binds the generated entry directly to its
closed native helper set, while freestanding standalone emission without an embedder fails closed.

`XrNativeArtifact` owns actual native bytes. `NativeArtifactId` hashes `ExecutionId`, `BackendId`,
`ToolchainId`, `OptimizationPolicyId`, and those bytes. Toolchain identity is reconstructible from
provider version, target triple, codegen options, sysroot, runtime objects, and target profile
fingerprints; every partition is checked exactly and mismatches fail closed.

The pure-AOT walking-skeleton executable contains no VM, compiler, program-loader, TargetPlan, or
AOT-toolchain symbol and executes without program bytes. All fifty current CoreSpec operations
have private BackendIR/C lowering. `core.logical.not`, `core.logical.and`, and `core.logical.or`
accept only canonical `bool` values and emit portable C logical expressions over already evaluated
SSA operands. Source expressions with a trapping or effectful right-hand side are projected into
explicit Program control flow, so short-circuit behavior does not depend on C expression evaluation
or an AOT-only convention. Wave 2 aggregate and variant rows become portable C11 structs and
tagged unions without a VM carrier or shared local layout. A source-built higher-order function
fixture proves that a callable borrowed through an ordinary function parameter has the same
reference, VM, and native generated-C result, and that repeated C emission is byte-identical. The
Pipe source fixture also executes guarded division-by-zero right-hand sides through generated C to
prove source short-circuit parity. The operation matrix separately records
which rows have a production source owner. Checked overflow, wrapping overflow, and division by zero
also compile and execute as independent native cases. Full language operation families, high-risk
optimizations, public loader ABI, and package publication remain inactive.
