# Typed TargetPlan frame contract

The typed frame is a runtime-only consumer of an immutable, independently
verified TargetPlan. It accepts exactly TargetPlan schema 19 with the complete
required family closure the production builder completes, and nothing else: the
accepted mask is that whole closure rather than a hand-kept subset of it, so a
family added to the closure cannot leave this boundary silently rejecting every
plan the builder emits.
Schema 19 is a breaking hard cutover: schema 18 and earlier and a plan missing
any required family fact are rejected
rather than reinterpreted. A schema or required family change must update this
boundary atomically; an older or partial plan is never interpreted through
compatibility logic.

The frame allocator is deliberately narrower than the accepted plan. It
allocates and accesses only the selected function's packed, trivial scalar
slots. Every slot access repeats the stable slot identity, physical size,
alignment, register representation, and memory representation from the plan.
The closure-storage family may contain a dynamic/owned/tagged outer `XrValue`
slot for an exact no-capture heap closure, but it does not describe the closure
object body, allocation, root map, root slot, or cleanup. Such a slot remains
outside this trivial frame allocator; Semantic ownership and the existing AOT
closure lifetime path retain those responsibilities.
The String-literal-storage family likewise describes only a dynamic/owned/
tagged outer value backed by the separate runtime String-literal
materialization contract. It adds no object body, allocation, root-map,
root-slot, cleanup, tuple, or general owned-String authority and remains
outside the trivial frame allocator.
The array-member-result-storage family describes only the dynamic/owned/tagged
outer value of an array member that hands back its own receiver. That result is
a second name for a container the array-allocation family already describes, so
this family adds no element storage, object body, allocation, root map, root
slot, cleanup, or layout of its own, and its slot stays outside the trivial
frame allocator.
The direct-local-callee-storage family describes only the borrowed dynamic
outer `XrValue` token loaded from one shared slot whose every use is the callee
of the same frozen direct-local call target. The target is the unique canonical
child of the first lexical shared-slot owner: either the caller itself or the
module root whose entry-prefix initializer precedes activation. This includes
root-owned sibling helpers but rejects an arbitrary ancestor, duplicate store,
or unrelated sibling. It grants no closure allocation, body, root map, cleanup,
or general indirect-call authority and remains outside the trivial frame
allocator.
The direct-local-GO-callee-storage family similarly describes only a borrowed
dynamic outer callable token produced by one canonical shared-slot
initializer and used exclusively as operand zero of exact `XI_GO` sites for
one canonical local child. It grants no GO result/task object, callable body,
allocation, root map, cleanup, argument storage, or execution path and remains
outside the trivial frame allocator.
The Channel-allocation-storage family describes the dynamic outer `XrValue`
returned by an exact frozen `XI_CHAN_NEW` as owned, and its exact identity-copy
aliases as borrowed. It does not describe the Channel object body, allocation
execution, root map, root slot, cleanup, transfer plan, or general object
storage and remains outside the trivial frame allocator.
The Channel-receive-storage family describes only the trivial scalar result
slot for an exact `XI_CHAN_TRY_RECV` whose Channel allocation identity and
element type have been independently frozen. It adds no Channel object layout,
receive scheduling, ownership transfer, aggregate payload, tuple payload,
root, or cleanup authority.
The direct-local-unit-enum-argument-storage family describes only a trivial
signed 64-bit ordinal whose source enum declaration, unit shape, nominal layout,
and exact direct-local parameter/argument relation are independently frozen.
It grants no payload enum, boxing, allocation, root, cleanup, dispatch, or
general enum inference authority.
The source-class-object-storage family describes only the owned dynamic outer
`XrValue` of an exact frozen class allocation, named through the plan's own
source-class table rather than through its erased result type. It grants no
class object body, field or method table, construction, root, cleanup, or
member lookup, and remains outside the trivial frame allocator.
The SOURCE-namespace-storage family describes only borrowed dynamic outer
`XrValue` tokens in an exact import/store/load chain whose load is consumed as
the receiver of a SOURCE_EXPORT call. It grants no imported module object
body, allocation, root, cleanup, dependency activation, argument ABI, or
cross-module frame and remains outside the trivial frame allocator.
SOURCE_EXPORT rows bind only an exact dependency public wrapper and its
coroutine state/result relation. They deliberately contain no local callee
index or cross-module argument/frame storage, so this typed frame grants them
no execution path.

The separate scalar dispatcher may use this frame only when an independently
verified, non-empty function instruction group grants its exact execution
family. Zero instruction rows mean execution unavailable. A trivial
signed-`i64` parameter-role slot is an ordinary uninitialized slot of this
frame at creation: the dispatcher fills it through the verified parameter row
that names its argument ordinal, so no slot is ever live before a store and
the frame gains no argument-passing authority of its own. A slot the
dispatcher writes on one path and reads on another is proved defined by the
instruction group's own control-flow judgement before the frame is created, so
the frame keeps its single rule that a load requires a prior store and gains no
knowledge of blocks or edges. The frame's supported family mask is the exact
completed closure the production builder emits, so a plan built for any other
closure is refused rather than executed against a frame that never saw one of
its families. The coroutine
state-call family proves only frozen state/resume/direct-call/result
relations; it contains no child-frame, spill, root, cleanup, drop, cancel, or
action authority. Aggregate, rooted, owned, caller-storage, coroutine, and
adapter execution is not implemented here and remains fail closed.

The plan also admits one sealed non-static call descriptor: an exact,
non-super, non-suspending `Channel.close()` operation reconstructed from
frozen SemanticPlan receiver, selector, arity, and Unit-result facts. The
receiver is only the dispatch target. The row has no callee function,
argument row, receiver slot, caller storage, or general method-call authority,
and this frame contract grants it no execution path.
It also admits one sealed zero-argument `StringBuilder()` constructor call
descriptor. The row binds the exact Semantic allocation identity to an owned
dynamic result slot and grants no generic builtin dispatch, object-body
layout, cleanup, or typed execution path.

The frame retains the plan, binds its exact fingerprint, keeps initialization
and poison state outside the untagged byte arena, enforces hard arena/slot/total
allocation budgets, and makes cleanup terminal. Frame creation recomputes the
target-content fingerprint without consulting SemanticPlan. No runtime type
tag, source type inference, legacy bytecode frame, or AOT value-plan fallback
may authorize an access.

Evidence:

- `test_typed_frame` proves exact schema/family/fingerprint rejection, packed
  access identity, initialization/poison/cleanup state, and allocation budgets.
- `test_typed_frame_runtime_archive` proves the public header and symbols link
  from the runtime-only archive without compiler or AOT ownership, and proves
  that the scalar dispatcher is present without activating it.
- `test_runtime_generation` proves that only a sole-function, nonempty scalar
  instruction plan may activate and consume this frame through the bounded
  generation executor; rooted, call, adapter, and coroutine plans remain
  unavailable.
- The runtime artifact archive gate separately proves activation only through
  the exact XSM/XTP sole-function generation route.
