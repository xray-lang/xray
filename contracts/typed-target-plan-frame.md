# Typed TargetPlan frame contract

The typed frame is a runtime-only consumer of an immutable, independently
verified TargetPlan. It accepts exactly TargetPlan schema 9 with the complete
scalar, aggregate, direct-local call, closure-storage, minimal coroutine
state-call, and String-literal-storage family mask. Schema 9 is a breaking hard
cutover: schema 8 and a plan missing any required family fact are rejected
rather than reinterpreted. A schema or required family change must update this
boundary atomically; an older or partial plan is never interpreted through
compatibility logic.

The frame allocator is deliberately narrower than the accepted plan. It
allocates and accesses only the selected function's packed, trivial scalar
slots. Every slot access repeats the stable slot identity, physical size,
alignment, register representation, and memory representation from the plan.
The closure-storage family may contain a dynamic/owned/tagged outer `XrValue`
slot for an exact no-capture heap closure, but it does not describe the closure
object body, allocation, root map, root slot, or cleanup. Such a slot remains
outside this trivial frame allocator; Semantic ownership and the existing AOT
closure lifetime path retain those responsibilities.
The String-literal-storage family likewise describes only a dynamic/owned/
tagged outer value backed by the separate runtime String-literal
materialization contract. It adds no object body, allocation, root-map,
root-slot, cleanup, tuple, or general owned-String authority and remains
outside the trivial frame allocator.

The separate scalar dispatcher may use this frame only when an independently
verified, non-empty function instruction group grants its exact execution
family. Zero instruction rows mean execution unavailable. The coroutine
state-call family proves only frozen state/resume/direct-call/result
relations; it contains no child-frame, spill, root, cleanup, drop, cancel, or
action authority. Aggregate, rooted, owned, caller-storage, coroutine, and
adapter execution is not implemented here and remains fail closed.

Schema 9 also admits one sealed non-static call descriptor: an exact,
non-super, non-suspending `Channel.close()` operation reconstructed from
frozen SemanticPlan receiver, selector, arity, and Unit-result facts. The
receiver is only the dispatch target. The row has no callee function,
argument row, receiver slot, caller storage, or general method-call authority,
and this frame contract grants it no execution path.

The frame retains the plan, binds its exact fingerprint, keeps initialization
and poison state outside the untagged byte arena, enforces hard arena/slot/total
allocation budgets, and makes cleanup terminal. Frame creation recomputes the
target-content fingerprint without consulting SemanticPlan. No runtime type
tag, source type inference, legacy bytecode frame, or AOT value-plan fallback
may authorize an access.

Evidence:

- `test_typed_frame` proves exact schema/family/fingerprint rejection, packed
  access identity, initialization/poison/cleanup state, and allocation budgets.
- `test_typed_frame_runtime_archive` proves the public header and symbols link
  from the runtime-only archive without compiler or AOT ownership.
- `test_runtime_generation` proves that only a sole-function, nonempty scalar
  instruction plan may activate and consume this frame through the bounded
  generation executor; rooted, call, adapter, and coroutine plans remain
  unavailable.
